We aim to gain a mechanistic understanding of the brain by studying fundamental information processing problems, that are evolutionarily conserved and can be readily studied in mice, the genetically most tractable mammal. Specifically, we focus on a simple computation, the ability to discriminate novel from familiar sensory stimuli.

In addition to the experimental work on novelty circuits, we develop novel brain interfaces to address current limitations for measuring and manipulating the brain
