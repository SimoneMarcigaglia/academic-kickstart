Flexible electronics for interfacing with the brain
Current electrocorticography (ECoG) arrays are based on passive technologies, having a reduced electrode count and generally low spatial resolution, which heavily under-samples cortical areas and provides a limited coverage of the brain. Microfabrication technologies, specifically thin-film electronics, provide a way to overcome this by integrating active electronics components, such as transistors, into large-area flexible substrates.

At NERF, we are currently working on active, flexible, µECoG based on thin-film electronics for high density neural recording.
