I aim to understand how processing of sensory information is modified in our brain to accompany our actions. I study the impact of behaviour in various sensory modalities such as vision and olfaction. In addition, I investigate the transformation of sensory information to encoding of value and learning by studying underlying dopaminergic mechanisms (i.e. beer vs water).

By combining these fundamental insights about brain function, I aim to probe the electrophysiological signatures of brain-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder.
