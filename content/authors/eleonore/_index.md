The question I would like to address during my PhD is how the information of novelty emerge from the neural network treatment of the stimulus.

I want to quantify precisely the novel versus familiar discrimination in an odor task with psychophysic methods. This will be combined with a chronic recording of the brain using a world leading technique of IMEC, the Neuropixel probe 2.0. Using my background in computational neuroscience, I will then build a model constraint by the behavior and the neural response to propose a theoretical mechanism of novelty detection.
