For decades the physical brain-machine interface has sparked inspiration inside the minds science fiction writers everywhere. In reality, it has become a bona fide and increasingly popular target for scientific research. My PhD research project at the Haesler lab aims to induce artificial synapse formation at the interface between neurons and neuroscience tools.

Utilizing the microfabrication facilities at imec and the molecular neuroscience expertise at VIB, we are developing surface functionalized electrodes for stable and specific interfacing with neurons. We believe our platform will prove a valuable tool for many aspects of neuroscience research such as electrophysiology, brain-on-chip technology, neuroprosthetics, and drug discovery.
