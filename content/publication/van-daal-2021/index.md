abstract: 'How dynamic activity in neural circuits gives rise to behaviour is a major
  area of interest in neuroscience. A key experimental approach for addressing this
  question involves measuring extracellular neuronal activity in awake, behaving animals.
  Recently developed Neuropixels probes have provided a step-change in recording neural
  activity in large tissue volumes with high spatiotemporal resolution. This protocol
  describes the chronic implantation of Neuropixels probes in mice and rats using
  compact and reusable 3D-printed fixtures. The fixtures facilitate stable chronic
  in-vivo recordings in freely behaving rats and mice. They consist of two parts:
  a covered main body and a skull connector. Single, dual, and movable probe fixture
  variants are available. After completing an experiment, probes are safely recovered
  for reimplantation by a dedicated retrieval mechanism. Fixture assembly and surgical
  implantation typically take 4-5 h, probe retrieval takes about half an hour, followed
  by a 12 h incubation in probe cleaning agent. The duration of data acquisition depends
  on the type of behavioral experiment. Since our protocol enables stable, chronic
  recordings over weeks, it enableslongitudinal large-scale single-unit data to be
  routinely obtained in a cost-efficient manner, which will facilitate many studies
  in systems neuroscience.'
