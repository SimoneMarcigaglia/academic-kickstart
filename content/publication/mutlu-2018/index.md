abstract: Background Respiratory rate is an essential parameter in biomedical research
  and clinical applications. Most respiration measurement techniques in preclinical
  animal models require surgical implantation of sensors. Current clinical measurement
  modalities typically involve attachment of sensors to the patient, causing discomfort.
  We have previously developed a non-contact approach to measuring respiration phase
  in head-restrained rodents using infrared (IR) thermography. While the non-invasive
  nature of IR thermography offers many advantages, it also bears the complexity of
  extracting respiration signals from videos. Previously reported algorithms involve
  image segmentation to identify the nose in IR videos and extract breathing-relevant
  pixels which is particularly challenging if the videos have low contrast or suffer
  from suboptimal focusing. New method To address this challenge, we developed a novel
  algorithm, which extracts respiration signals based on pixel time series, removing
  the need for nose-tracking and image segmentation. Results & comparison with existing
  methods We validated the algorithm by performing respiration measurements in head-restrained
  mice and in humans with IR thermography in parallel with established standard techniques.
  We find the algorithm reliably detects inhalation onsets with high temporal precision.
  Conclusions The new algorithm facilitates the application of IR thermography for
  measuring respiration in biomedical research and in clinical settings.
