 abstract = {Studying the relationship between the activity of neuronal populations and behavior is critical to advance our understanding of brain function. Assays in which animals are unrestrained that promote naturalistic behaviors are better suited for the study of cognitive functions such as navigation or social interactions. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings provide the high temporal resolution to monitor single cells spiking activity as well as local field potentials. Recent technological advances have enhanced the sampling capabilities of neural probes. A single Neuropixels probe[1] enables recording from over 380 switchable electrodes distributed along the 10mm long probe shank. It offers the possibility to simultaneously record from several hundred cells from multiple brain regions in awake animals. Neuropixels probes have been successfully used in chronic preparations, with stable recordings over time and high cluster fidelity. However, at present little to no technical support exists to use these devices chronically in unrestrained behaving animals. In particular, current designs for chronic implants lack an efficient mechanism to recover the probes and do not support the integration of multiple probes in a single implant. We have developed a 3D-printed implants for Neuropixels probes that facilitates the reliable use, and re-use, of probes chronically implanted in freely behaving rodents. The implants meet three key criteria: 1) it is lightweight and can be easily carried by rats and mice, 2) it enables chronic insertion of several Neuropixels probes at flexible coordinates, and 3) the neural probes are easily recovered and reused with high success rate. The 3D-printed implant has been successfully used to record from populations of cells over days in our lab. Overall, the system has the potential to facilitate and broaden the use of Neuropixels probes, and potentially similar devices, in chronic preparations for freely behaving animals.
