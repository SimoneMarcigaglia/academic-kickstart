abstract: 'Studying the relationship between the activity of neuronal populations
  and behavior is critical to advance our understanding of brain function. Assays
  in which animals are unrestrained that promote naturalistic behaviors are better
  suited for the study of cognitive functions such as navigation or social interactions.
  Extracellular electrophysiological recordings provide the high temporal resolution
  to monitor single cells spiking activity as well as local field potentials. Recent
  technological advances have enhanced the sampling capabilities of neural probes.
  A single Neuropixels probe[1] enables recording from over 380 switchable electrodes
  distributed along the 10mm long probe shank. It offers the possibility to simultaneously
  record from several hundred cells from multiple brain regions in awake animals.
  Neuropixels probes have been successfully used in chronic preparations, with stable
  recordings over time and high cluster fidelity. However, at present little to no
  technical support exists to use these devices chronically in unrestrained behaving
  animals. In particular, current designs for chronic implants lack an efficient mechanism
  to recover the probes and do not support the integration of multiple probes in a
  single implant. We have developed a 3D-printed implants for Neuropixels probes that
  facilitates the reliable use, and re-use, of probes chronically implanted in freely
  behaving rodents. The implants meet three key criteria: 1) it is lightweight and
  can be easily carried by rats and mice, 2) it enables chronic insertion of several
  Neuropixels probes at flexible coordinates, and 3) the neural probes are easily
  recovered and reused with high success rate. The 3D-printed implant has been successfully
  used to record from populations of cells over days in our lab. Overall, the system
  has the potential to facilitate and broaden the use of Neuropixels probes, and potentially
  similar devices, in chronic preparations for freely behaving animals. [1] Jun J.J.
