abstract: Summary Dopamine neurons mediate the association of conditioned stimuli
  (CS) with reward (unconditioned stimuli, US) by signaling the discrepancy between
  predicted and actual reward during the US. Some theoretical models suggest that
  learning is also influenced by the salience or associability of the CS. A hallmark
  of CS associability models is that they can explain latent inhibition, i.e., the
  observation that novel CS are more effectively learned than familiar CS. Novel CS
  are known to activate dopamine neurons, but whether those responses affect associative
  learning has not been investigated. Here, we used fiber photometry to characterize
  dopamine responses to inconsequential familiar and novel stimuli. Using bidirectional
  optogenetic modulation during conditioning, we then show that CS-evoked dopamine
  promotes conditioned responses. This suggests that Pavlovian conditioning is influenced
  by CS dopamine, in addition to US reward prediction errors. Accordingly, the absence
  of dopamine responses to familiar CS might explain their slower learning in latent
  inhibition.
