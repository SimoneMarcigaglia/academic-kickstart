abstract: 'Dopamine has a central role in motivation and reward. Dopaminergic neurons
  in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) signal the discrepancy between expected and
  actual rewards (that is, reward prediction error), but how they compute such signals
  is unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA neurons while mice associated different
  odour cues with appetitive and aversive outcomes. We found three types of neuron
  based on responses to odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type
  I, 52%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a
  manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of neurons
  showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated
  positively (type II, 31%) or negatively (type III, 18%) by the value of outcomes.
  Whereas the activity of type I neurons was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is,
  when the reward was delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted),
  the activity of type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by reward-predicting
  odours. We tagged dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein
  channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to optical stimulation
  while recording. All identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic
  neurons were of type II. These results show that VTA GABAergic neurons signal expected
  reward, a key variable for dopaminergic neurons to calculate reward prediction error.
