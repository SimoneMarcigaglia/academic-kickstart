abstract: Implanted neural interfaces represent a rapidly growing field, which includes
  deep brain, peroneal, phrenic, and vagus nerve stimulators, while substantial research
  efforts have been invested in the development of experimental applications, such
  as cortical prostheses, retinal prostheses, spinal cord stimulators, etc. The aim
  of the present chapter is to provide a gap analysis of the field and to debate where
  future efforts must be directed. The presented gap analysis is intended to informing
  preventive actions or design decisions for further improvement of the design, fabrication,
  and exploitation methods of implants. The development of more compliant electrodes
  remains the main technological challenge. In our view, more efforts in the understanding
  of the mechanical interactions of an electrode with the surrounding tissue are necessary
  in order to achieve the next technological breakthrough. The systematic analysis
  of failure modes of neural interfaces appears to be a key enabling factor for further
  progress in the field and overall device improvements. Enabling such analysis calls
  for the implementation of more comprehensive reporting systems, capturing the necessary
  information.
