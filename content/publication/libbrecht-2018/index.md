abstract: Optogenetic manipulations are widely used for investigating the contribution
  of genetically identified cell types to behavior. Simultaneous electrophysiological
  recordings are less common, although they are critical for characterizing the specific
  impact of optogenetic manipulations on neural circuits in vivo. This is at least
  in part because combining photostimulation with large-scale electrophysiological
  recordings remains technically challenging, which also poses a limitation for performing
  extracellular identification experiments. Currently available interfaces that guide
  light of the appropriate wavelength into the brain combined with an electrophysiological
  modality suffer from various drawbacks such as a bulky size, low spatial resolution,
  heat dissipation, or photovoltaic artifacts. To address these challenges, we have
  designed and fabricated an integrated ultrathin neural interface with 12 optical
  outputs and 24 electrodes. We used the device to measure the effect of localized
  stimulation in the anterior olfactory cortex, a paleocortical structure involved
  in olfactory processing. Our experiments in adult mice demonstrate that because
  of its small dimensions, our novel tool causes far less tissue damage than commercially
  available devices. Moreover, optical stimulation and recording can be performed
  simultaneously, with no measurable electrical artifact during optical stimulation.
  Importantly, optical stimulation can be confined to small volumes with approximately
  single-cortical layer thickness. Finally, we find that even highly localized optical
  stimulation causes inhibition at more distant sites. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study,
  we establish a novel tool for simultaneous extracellular recording and optogenetic
  photostimulation. Because the device is built using established microchip technology,
  it can be fabricated with high reproducibility and reliability. We further show
  that even very localized stimulation affects neural firing far beyond the stimulation
  site. This demonstrates the difficulty in predicting circuit-level effects of optogenetic
  manipulations and highlights the importance of closely monitoring neural activity
  in optogenetic experiments.
