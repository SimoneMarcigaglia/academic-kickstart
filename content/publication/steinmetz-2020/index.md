abstract: To study the dynamics of neural processing across timescales, we require
  the ability to follow the spiking of thousands of individually separable neurons
  over weeks and months, during unrestrained behavior. To address this need, we introduce
  the Neuropixels 2.0 probe together with novel analysis algorithms. The new probe
  has over 5,000 sites and is miniaturized such that two probes plus a headstage,
  recording 768 sites at once, weigh just over 1 g, suitable for implanting chronically
  in small mammals. Recordings with high quality signals persisting for at least two
  months were reliably obtained in two species and six different labs. Improved site
  density and arrangement combined with new data processing methods enable automatic
  post-hoc stabilization of data despite brain movements during behavior and across
  days, allowing recording from the same neurons in the mouse visual cortex for over
  2 months. Additionally, an optional configuration allows for recording from multiple
  sites per available channel, with a penalty to signal-to-noise ratio. These probes
  and algorithms enable stable recordings from &gt;10,000 sites during free behavior
  in small animals such as mice.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared
  no competing interest.
