abstract: Technological advances have the potential to dramatically increase our understanding
  of the human brain, treat and cure injury and disease, and enhance our general well-being.
  While advances in neuroscience hold great promise, they also raise profound ethical,
  legal, and social questions. In this vein, the Organization for Economic Co-operation
  and Development (OECD) convened an international workshop in September 2016 to explore
  responsible research and innovation in brain science.
