abstract: 'Moore s law in neural sciences: we present an optical neural probe (optoprobe)
  with the highest integration density of optrodes-electrodes using a CMOS process
  platform in 193 nm lithography. We designed, developed, and packaged an ultrathin
  (30 $μ$m) optical neural probe, co-integrating silicon nitride (SixNy) photonics
  and biocompatible titanium nitride (TiN) electrodes (1). Functionality was verified
  in vivo by optically evoking and electrically recording neuronal activity in a mouse
  brain. Our design takes advantage of CMOS technology and incorporates 12 miniaturized
  optical outputs (optrodes) placed symmetrically next to 24 recording electrodes
  on a narrow 100-$μ$m wide shank. We achieved an unprecedented optrode density by
  integrating grating couplers (GCs) instead of traditional end-butt coupling. The
  size of each optrode and electrode is 6 × 20 $μ$m2 and 10 × 10 $μ$m2 respectively,
  which is the typical size of a neuron. The system was capable of local excitation
  and recording of transduced neurons, a breakthrough achieved by the high-density
  integration.'
