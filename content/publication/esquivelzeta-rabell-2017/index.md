abstract: Summary Navigation, finding food sources, and avoiding danger critically
  depend on the identification and spatial localization of airborne chemicals. When
  monitoring the olfactory environment, rodents spontaneously engage in active olfactory
  sampling behavior, also referred to as exploratory sniffing [1]. Exploratory sniffing
  is characterized by stereotypical high-frequency respiration, which is also reliably
  evoked by novel odorant stimuli [2, 3]. To study novelty-induced exploratory sniffing,
  we developed a novel, non-contact method for measuring respiration by infrared (IR)
  thermography in a behavioral paradigm in which novel and familiar stimuli are presented
  to head-restrained mice. We validated the method by simultaneously performing nasal
  pressure measurements, a commonly used invasive approach [2, 4], and confirmed highly
  reliable detection of inhalation onsets. We further discovered that mice actively
  orient their nostrils toward novel, previously unexperienced, smells. In line with
  the remarkable speed of olfactory processing reported previously [3, 5, 6], we find
  that mice initiate their response already within the first sniff after odor onset.
  Moreover, transecting the anterior commissure (AC) disrupted orienting, indicating
  that the orienting response requires interhemispheric transfer of information. This
  suggests that mice compare odorant information obtained from the two bilaterally
  symmetric nostrils to locate the source of the novel odorant. We further demonstrate
  that asymmetric activation of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) is both necessary
  and sufficient for eliciting orienting responses. These findings support the view
  that the AON plays an important role in the internostril difference comparison underlying
  rapid odor source localization.
