abstract = {Deep brain stimulation is an established surgical treatment for several neurological and movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, in which electrostimulation is applied to targeted deep nuclei in the basal ganglia through implanted electrode leads. Recent technological improvements in the field have focused on the theoretical advantage of current steering and adaptive (closed-loop) deep brain stimulation. Current steering between several active electrodes would allow for improved accuracy when targeting the desired brain structures. This has the additional benefit of avoiding undesired stimulation of neural tracts that are related to side effects, e.g., internal capsule fibres of passage in subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. Closed-loop deep brain stimulation is based on the premise of continuous recording of a proxy for pathological neural activity (such as beta-band power of measured local field potentials in patients with Parkinson's disease) and accordingly adapting the used stimulus parameters. In this study, we investigate the suitability of an existing highresolution neurorecording probe for high-precision neurostimulation. If a subset of the probe's recording electrodes can be used for stimulation, then the probe would be a suitable candidate for closed-loop deep brain stimulation. A finiteelement model is used to calculate the electric potential, induced by current injection through the high-resolution probe, for different sets of active electrodes. Volumes of activated tissue are calculated and a comparison is made between the highresolution probe and a conventional stimulation lead. We investigate the capability of the probe to shift the volume of activated tissue by steering currents to different sets of active electrodes. Finally, safety limits for the injected current are used to determine the size of the volume in which neurons can be activated with the relatively small electrodes patches on the highresolution probe.},

abstract = {Studying the relationship between the activity of neuronal populations and behavior is critical to advance our understanding of brain function. Assays in which animals are unrestrained that promote naturalistic behaviors are better suited for the study of cognitive functions such as navigation or social interactions. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings provide the high temporal resolution to monitor single cells spiking activity as well as local field potentials. Recent technological advances have enhanced the sampling capabilities of neural probes. A single Neuropixels probe[1] enables recording from over 380 switchable electrodes distributed along the 10mm long probe shank. It offers the possibility to simultaneously record from several hundred cells from multiple brain regions in awake animals. Neuropixels probes have been successfully used in chronic preparations, with stable recordings over time and high cluster fidelity. However, at present little to no technical support exists to use these devices chronically in unrestrained behaving animals. In particular, current designs for chronic implants lack an efficient mechanism to recover the probes and do not support the integration of multiple probes in a single implant. We have developed a 3D-printed implants for Neuropixels probes that facilitates the reliable use, and re-use, of probes chronically implanted in freely behaving rodents. The implants meet three key criteria: 1) it is lightweight and can be easily carried by rats and mice, 2) it enables chronic insertion of several Neuropixels probes at flexible coordinates, and 3) the neural probes are easily recovered and reused with high success rate. The 3D-printed implant has been successfully used to record from populations of cells over days in our lab. Overall, the system has the potential to facilitate and broaden the use of Neuropixels probes, and potentially similar devices, in chronic preparations for freely behaving animals.

abstract = {Dopamine has a central role in motivation and reward. Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) signal the discrepancy between expected and actual rewards (that is, reward prediction error), but how they compute such signals is unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA neurons while mice associated different odour cues with appetitive and aversive outcomes. We found three types of neuron based on responses to odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I, 52{\%}) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated positively (type II, 31{\%}) or negatively (type III, 18{\%}) by the value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We tagged dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons were of type II. These results show that VTA GABAergic neurons signal expected reward, a key variable for dopaminergic neurons to calculate reward prediction error. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Morrens2020,
abstract = {Dopamine neurons mediate the association of conditioned stimuli (CS) with reward (unconditioned stimuli, US) by signaling the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward during the US. Some theoretical models suggest that learning is also influenced by the salience or associability of the CS. A hallmark of CS associability models is that they can explain latent inhibition, i.e., the observation that novel CS are more effectively learned than familiar CS. Novel CS are known to activate dopamine neurons, but whether those responses affect associative learning has not been investigated. Here, we used fiber photometry to characterize dopamine responses to inconsequential familiar and novel stimuli. Using bidirectional optogenetic modulation during conditioning, we then show that CS-evoked dopamine promotes conditioned responses. This suggests that Pavlovian conditioning is influenced by CS dopamine, in addition to US reward prediction errors. Accordingly, the absence of dopamine responses to familiar CS might explain their slower learning in latent inhibition.},

@article{EsquivelzetaRabell2017,
abstract = {Navigation, finding food sources, and avoiding danger critically depend on the identification and spatial localization of airborne chemicals. When monitoring the olfactory environment, rodents spontaneously engage in active olfactory sampling behavior, also referred to as exploratory sniffing [1]. Exploratory sniffing is characterized by stereotypical high-frequency respiration, which is also reliably evoked by novel odorant stimuli [2, 3]. To study novelty-induced exploratory sniffing, we developed a novel, non-contact method for measuring respiration by infrared (IR) thermography in a behavioral paradigm in which novel and familiar stimuli are presented to head-restrained mice. We validated the method by simultaneously performing nasal pressure measurements, a commonly used invasive approach [2, 4], and confirmed highly reliable detection of inhalation onsets. We further discovered that mice actively orient their nostrils toward novel, previously unexperienced, smells. In line with the remarkable speed of olfactory processing reported previously [3, 5, 6], we find that mice initiate their response already within the first sniff after odor onset. Moreover, transecting the anterior commissure (AC) disrupted orienting, indicating that the orienting response requires interhemispheric transfer of information. This suggests that mice compare odorant information obtained from the two bilaterally symmetric nostrils to locate the source of the novel odorant. We further demonstrate that asymmetric activation of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) is both necessary and sufficient for eliciting orienting responses. These findings support the view that the AON plays an important role in the internostril difference comparison underlying rapid odor source localization.},

abstract = {Optogenetic manipulations are widely used for investigating the contribution of genetically identified cell types to behavior. Simultaneous electrophysiological recordings are less common, although they are critical for characterizing the specific impact of optogenetic manipulations on neural circuits in vivo. This is at least in part because combining photostimulation with large-scale electrophysiological recordings remains technically challenging, which also poses a limitation for performing extracellular identification experiments. Currently available interfaces that guide light of the appropriate wavelength into the brain combined with an electrophysiological modality suffer from various drawbacks such as a bulky size, low spatial resolution, heat dissipation, or photovoltaic artifacts. To address these challenges, we have designed and fabricated an integrated ultrathin neural interface with 12 optical outputs and 24 electrodes. We used the device to measure the effect of localized stimulation in the anterior olfactory cortex, a paleocortical structure involved in olfactory processing. Our experiments in adult mice demonstrate that because of its small dimensions, our novel tool causes far less tissue damage than commercially available devices. Moreover, optical stimulation and recording can be performed simultaneously, with no measurable electrical artifact during optical stimulation. Importantly, optical stimulation can be confined to small volumes with approximately single-cortical layer thickness. Finally, we find that even highly localized optical stimulation causes inhibition at more distant sites. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY In this study, we establish a novel tool for simultaneous extracellular recording and optogenetic photostimulation. Because the device is built using established microchip technology, it can be fabricated with high reproducibility and reliability. We further show that even very localized stimulation affects neural firing far beyond the stimulation site. This demonstrates the difficulty in predicting circuit-level effects of optogenetic manipulations and highlights the importance of closely monitoring neural activity in optogenetic experiments.},

Functionality was verified in vivo by optically evoking and electrically recording neuronal activity in a mouse brain. Our design takes advantage of CMOS technology and incorporates 12 miniaturized optical outputs (optrodes) placed symmetrically next to 24 recording electrodes on a narrow 100-$\mu$m wide shank. We achieved an unprecedented optrode density by integrating grating couplers (GCs) instead of traditional end-butt coupling. The size of each optrode and electrode is 6 × 20 $\mu$m2 and 10 × 10 $\mu$m2 respectively, which is the typical size of a neuron. The system was capable of local excitation and recording of transduced neurons, a breakthrough achieved by the high-density integration.},
